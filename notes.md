- I'm currently working on creating a login component using hardcoded values, which I plan to replace with real authentication once I've familiarized myself with Spring Security.

## Dependencies Used in Project Setup:

- Spring Web: A module in the Spring Framework for building web applications. It provides features for handling HTTP requests, managing web sessions, and more.

- Spring Data JPA: Part of the Spring Data project, it simplifies the implementation of data access layers for JPA (Java Persistence API) based repositories. It reduces boilerplate code and offers convenient methods for CRUD operations.

- H2 Database: A lightweight, in-memory database often used for development and testing purposes. It's particularly useful for Spring Boot applications due to its ease of setup and integration.

- Spring Boot Devtools: A set of tools aimed at improving the development experience with Spring Boot. It provides features such as automatic application restarts, hot swapping of code changes, and enhanced logging.

## Group ID in Spring Boot:

What is it? The group id is a unique identifier used in Maven projects to group related projects together.

Why is it important? It helps ensure that your project has a distinct identity within your organization or project group, preventing naming conflicts.

Example: If your organization's domain is example.com and your project is called "my-project", your group id might be com.example.

Usage: When creating a Spring Boot project with Maven, you provide a group id along with other coordinates (artifact id and version).

## Maven Project Architecture

- src/main/java: This directory contains the Java source code files of the main application. It's where you place your Java classes, packages, and other Java-related resources.

- src/main/resources: This directory holds non-Java resources that are needed for the main application, such as configuration files, property files, XML files, and static resources like images or CSS files.

- src/test/java: Similar to src/main/java, this directory contains Java source code files, but specifically for test classes. It's where you write unit tests, integration tests, or other types of tests for your application.

- src/test/resources: This directory contains non-Java resources that are needed for testing, such as test configuration files or test data files.

- pom.xml: This is the Project Object Model (POM) file for your Maven project. It's an XML file that defines the project configuration, including dependencies, plugins, build settings, and other project-specific information.

- target: This directory is automatically generated by Maven and contains the output of the build process, such as compiled classes, JAR files, WAR files, and other artifacts.

- mvnw and mvnw.cmd: These are wrapper scripts for Maven that allow you to run Maven commands without having to install Maven separately on your system. They ensure that the correct version of Maven is used for your project.

@RestController:

- What it does: This annotation is a combination of the @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations. It's used to define RESTful web services in Spring MVC.

- Purpose: Marks a class as a controller where each method returns data meant to be serialized directly into the HTTP response body. Essentially, it tells Spring that the return values of the methods should be sent back to the client as-is, without any view rendering.

@RequestMapping:

- What it does: This annotation maps HTTP requests to handler methods in Spring MVC controllers.

- Purpose: Specifies the URL path or paths at which a controller method can be accessed. It allows you to define the endpoint for your RESTful web service.

- Usage: It can be applied at the class level to define a base URL for all methods in the controller, and/or at the method level to define additional URL paths or specify HTTP request methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that the method can handle.

@GetMapping:

- What it does: Tags a method to handle web requests for specific URLs.

- How it works: You put @GetMapping before a method in your Java class. When someone visits that URL, Spring calls that method and sends back whatever it returns.

## Request Methods for REST API

- GET - Retrieve details of resource
- POST - Create new resource
- PUT - Update an existing resource
- PATCH - Update part of a resource
- DELETE - Delete a resource

# DAO (Data Access Object)

- Is like a helper that knows how to talk to a database, fetch data from it, and save data to it, making it easier for your program to work with databases without having to deal with all the details itself.

## React Context:

- Context allows sharing data between components without manual passing through every level of the component tree.

- Instead of passing data from parent to children and then to their children, provide it once at the top level using Context.

- Any component in the tree can access this data, making sharing across different parts of the application easier and cleaner.
