- I'm currently working on creating a login component using hardcoded values, which I plan to replace with real authentication once I've familiarized myself with Spring Security.

Sure, here's a rephrased version with brief descriptions:

Dependencies Used in Project Setup:

- Spring Web: A module in the Spring Framework for building web applications. It provides features for handling HTTP requests, managing web sessions, and more.

- Spring Data JPA: Part of the Spring Data project, it simplifies the implementation of data access layers for JPA (Java Persistence API) based repositories. It reduces boilerplate code and offers convenient methods for CRUD operations.

- H2 Database: A lightweight, in-memory database often used for development and testing purposes. It's particularly useful for Spring Boot applications due to its ease of setup and integration.

- Spring Boot Devtools: A set of tools aimed at improving the development experience with Spring Boot. It provides features such as automatic application restarts, hot swapping of code changes, and enhanced logging.

Group ID in Spring Boot:

What is it? The group id is a unique identifier used in Maven projects to group related projects together.

Why is it important? It helps ensure that your project has a distinct identity within your organization or project group, preventing naming conflicts.

Example: If your organization's domain is example.com and your project is called "my-project", your group id might be com.example.

Usage: When creating a Spring Boot project with Maven, you provide a group id along with other coordinates (artifact id and version).

React Context:

- Context allows sharing data between components without manual passing through every level of the component tree.

- Instead of passing data from parent to children and then to their children, provide it once at the top level using Context.

- Any component in the tree can access this data, making sharing across different parts of the application easier and cleaner.
