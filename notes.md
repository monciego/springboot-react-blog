- I'm currently working on creating a login component using hardcoded values, which I plan to replace with real authentication once I've familiarized myself with Spring Security.

React Context:

- Context allows sharing data between components without manual passing through every level of the component tree.

- Instead of passing data from parent to children and then to their children, provide it once at the top level using Context.

- Any component in the tree can access this data, making sharing across different parts of the application easier and cleaner.
